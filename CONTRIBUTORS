Litebooru Contributors

Some code in Litebooru is taken from Derpibooru (https://derpibooru.org/).
Of the Derpibooru team, I'd like to thank these people for their contributions to this codebase:

- Clover the Clever, for starting this all off
- @k-anon for writing SearchParser, and providing inspiration for the current fancy_search API
- @barbeque-squared for some JavaScript that is used in dropdowns
